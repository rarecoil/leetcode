# leetcode solutions

### Answers to leetcode questions in JavaScript

These are solutions I provided to [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) for various challenges.
Note that these are **not** hyper-optimized, clean, or otherwise anything other than a raw
attempt at solving the questions. I am absolutely nowhere near a competitive algorist, and
these are meant to keep me from forgetting DSA questions I may need to remember at some point.

I will update this repository in batches as I solve more LeetCode problems.
